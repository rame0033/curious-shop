### Choose the silver bracelet
The bracelet shimmers, and for a brief moment, the world around you fades. The shelves, the dusty air, even the sounds of your friendsâ€”they all blur, leaving only the bracelet in your hand, glowing softly and pulsing with quiet urgency. You feel as if time itself has paused, and all that matters is the bracelet, pulling you forward.

Ahead of you, in the dim light, you notice the pedestal with a small, intricately carved box resting on it.
